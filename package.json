  "description": "- This is an API testing project where I will be using [restful-booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html) for my REST API as it is well documented. - The objective is to automate the test cases I have written to validate the end-points using the Chai library and to learn Bruno for future use. - I also want to explore alternative API clients. I want something that allows me to use Git, not lock me into creating an account. Bruno is a Git-friendly and offline-first open-source API client, there's no logging into an account, and there is no cloud connection or syncing of the work you do in Bruno.",
